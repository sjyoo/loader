=head2 type_string

=over 4



=item Description

A type string copied from WS spec.
Specifies the type and its version in a single string in the format
[module].[typename]-[major].[minor]:

module - a string. The module name of the typespec containing the type.
typename - a string. The name of the type as assigned by the typedef
        statement. For external type, it start with “e_”.
major - an integer. The major version of the type. A change in the
        major version implies the type has changed in a non-backwards
        compatible way.
minor - an integer. The minor version of the type. A change in the
        minor version implies that the type has changed in a way that is
        backwards compatible with previous type definitions.

In many cases, the major and minor versions are optional, and if not
provided the most recent version will be used.

Example: MyModule.MyType-3.1
